**Face Blur: React / Flask Application**

The client contains a react frontend that posts to two routes on the flask server.

The routes are /save and /find

**/save**

This route saves the image to a folder as one of the images to find a face in and blur


**/find**

This route sends a face to the server to find and blur if it exists in the saved images.
